# MEAN-Stack-Practice
Project is entirely from the MEAN Web Development book written by Amos Shaviv.
There were several bugs and issues when following the book's code word for word, but such
issues have been resolved. At the time of this README, I am still working through the book,
but noting any error I come across. Thus far, only 2 primary issues to prevent any further progress
with the example project.
